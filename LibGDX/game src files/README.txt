This project was made for a final in a class called Object Oriented Programming. This class had all of the students taking it to learn java as an Object Oriented Language. This project is a simple game that was made for a finals project. When you open the game, it brings you to a tutorial screen that teaches you how to move your character, then after you learn how to move and jump, you are put into the main game world. Due to crunch time, I couldn't add enemies or an ending. For this project, we all learned I learned libGDX as so I could make this game.
